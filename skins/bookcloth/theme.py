"""Bookcloth -- the player as a hand-bound stationery object.

A cover wrapped in clay-orange book cloth with the weave showing, paper panels
let into the boards with bevelled cut edges, labels letterpressed into the
stock so they cast a deboss shadow, linen thread stitching, and slate ink that
has bled a hair into the fibres.  The only light skin in the set.

The art lives in ``bookcloth_art``; this file maps the skinkit hooks onto it
and supplies the tokens, the palettes and the readme.

Fan-made tribute skin.  It evokes a warm, humane, hand-made visual language
through materials, palette and type, and signs itself with its own letterpress
monogram (a serif T, and a lozenge where the mark is small); it does not
reproduce anyone's logo or wordmark.
